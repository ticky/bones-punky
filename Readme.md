# Punky Pong

A restoration of Bones' Punky Pong flash game from 2009. Based on the archived version at <https://web.archive.org/web/20100113173616if_/http://www.fox.com/bones/features/game/>, which doesn't work

I'm sad to say it's not very good; I wasted a lot of time on this. You'll need a browser with Flash enabled to run it. Those are becoming more and more rare!
